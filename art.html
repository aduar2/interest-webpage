      <h1> My Little Art Gallery! </h1>
     
      <p> Welcome, to my digital art gallery! Recently, I've spent a lot of my free time drawing and painting. I do both traditional and digital art, but
        almost always draw people.
        I've enjoyed art my whole life, from art museums to scribbling when I was bored. I only started drawing as frequently as I do now in 7th grade.
        Here's some of my favorite artwork I've done recently:
        (sorted by medium)
         <table style="width:100%">
          <tr>
            <th>Watercolor and pencil</th>
            <th>Alcohol marker</th> 
            <th>Oil paint</th>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td> <img src = "sketch1.HEIC" alt = "a pencil sketch of a girl"> </td>
             <td> <img src = "character2.HEIC" alt = "a marker drawing of a blonde painter"> </td> 
             <td> <img src = "portrait3.jpg" alt = "an oil pastel of a girl with red hair and fox ears"> </td>
           </tr>
           <tr>
             <td> <img src = "portrait1.HEIC" alt = "a portrait of my sister">< /td>
               <td> <img src = "portrait3.jpg" alt = "a pencil s"> </td> 
               <td>94</td>
               </tr>
      </table>
           </p>
  </body>
