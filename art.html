      <h1> My Little Art Gallery! </h1>
     
      <p> Welcome, to my digital art gallery! Recently, I've spent a lot of my free time drawing and painting. I do both traditional and digital art, but
        almost always draw people.
        I've enjoyed art my whole life, from art museums to scribbling when I was bored. I only started drawing as frequently as I do now in 7th grade.
        Here's some of my favorite artwork I've done recently:
