    <h1> My Little Art Gallery! </h1>
     
    <p> Welcome to my digital art gallery! Recently, I've spent a lot of my free time drawing and painting. I do both traditional and digital art, but
        almost always draw people.
    </p>

        I've enjoyed art my whole life, from art museums to scribbling when I was bored. I only started drawing as frequently as I do now in 7th grade.
        Here's some of my favorite artwork I've done recently, ranging from doodles to portraits:

      <tr>
        <td> <img src = "sketch1.jpeg" alt = "a pencil sketch of a girl"> </td>
